## 1. Introduction

In the dynamic world of the NBA, the ability to accurately predict team success is invaluable. This project delves into the advanced metrics that potentially influence NBA team win percentages, exploring the statistical underpinnings that drive team performance. By harnessing linear regression, polynomial regression with Lasso, decision trees, and random forests, we aim to shed light on how metrics such as three-point shooting efficiency (`3pt_pct`), rebound rate (`rr`), and true shooting percentage (`ts%`) correlate with winning.
